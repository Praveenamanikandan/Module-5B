## Aim
Create a pandas  program to to get the items of series A not present in series B?




## Algorithm
```
Step 1: Start the program. 
Step 2: Take the necessary input(s) from the user. 
Step 3: Process the input(s) using suitable operations or conditions. 
Step 4: Display the result/output to the user. Step 5: Stop the program.

```
## Program
```
import pandas as pd

# Read lists from input
a1 = eval(input())  # For example: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
a2 = eval(input())  # For example: [4, 5, 6, 7, 8]

# Print only the Series for a1 as expected
print(pd.Series(a1))

```


## Output
